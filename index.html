                    The second game project I did with nine others out of my current university. The goal was to create a prototype of a game, given a set of themes.
                    It is a murder mystery/horror game with puzzle elements in which the player is caught between two realities. The 'real' world set in the players room and the ingame world in which a crime has to be solved. The ingame world is accessible via a futuristic VR headset in its beta phase and therefore bringing unforeseen consequences.
                    The gameplay is dialog heavy, requiring you to talk to the npcs and searching for clues.
