                    The second game project I did with eight others out of my current university. The goal was to create a prototype of a game, given a set of themes.
                    It is a murder mystery/horror game with puzzle elements in which the player is caught between two realities. The 'real' world set in the players room and the ingame world in which a crime has to be solved. The ingame world is accessible via a futuristic VR headset in its beta phase and therefore bringing unforeseen consequences.
                    The gameplay is dialog heavy, requiring you to talk to the npcs and searching for clues.
                    </p>
                    <p>I have been the sole programmer, while also being relevant for sound and general design. A few of my tasks have been: </p>

                    <p><br>To the left is a showcase of the glitch shader used in the project. The shader itself is higly customizable, which is why the video shows four different settings, going from low to high. The     setup has been created as another submission for my university.</p>

                    <p>This is the first prototype of a game we, as a group of nine, had to complete. It had to have a grounded design in context of aerospace. Our idea was to create top down arcade style levels for a selection of flying vehicles. A preview of the Spitfire level can be seen on the left. As this was the first project, a lot of time has been used to get to know Unity and its possibilities. The new Input System for expample has been a challenge to use, requiring workarounds, but resulting in dynamic control settings, which have been used and improved for (Virtual) Reality too. Another challenge has been the non intellegent AI for the enemies. Although it did not end up perfectly, it had been adequate for our first project.</p>
